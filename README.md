*A simple Vue + Vite + GitHub Pages powered resume template.*

## Docs

### Running locally

To test locally, run the following in your terminal:

1. Clone repo locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to `localhost:5173/resume-template/`

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

#### Options/configuration

Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/src/assets/resume_config.json` file.

You can add as many languages as you like, as long as you fill the other *json* files accordingly.

#### Editing content

Most of the content configuration will take place in the `/src/assets/*.json` files. Simply edit the json files there.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages for free

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. 
Just make sure you're following the right directions to do so. 
Follow the instructions at the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) and 
remember to edit the *vite.config.js* file accordingly to your repository

### Configuring with your own domain name

To setup your GH Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
