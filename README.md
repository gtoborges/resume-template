# Resume template

*A simple Vue + Vite + GitHub Pages powered resume template.*

## Docs

### Running locally

To test locally, run the following in your terminal:

1. Clone repo locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to `localhost:5173/resume-template/`

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

#### Options/configuration

Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/src/assets/resume_config.json` file.

This fork remade the project with Vite and Vue. One feature of translation was added to the project.
You can add as many languages as you like, as long as you fill the other *json* files accordingly.

#### Editing content

Most of the content configuration will take place in the `/src/assets/*.json` files. Simply edit the json files there.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages for free

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will host this for free with your GitHub account. 
Just make sure you're following the right directions to do so. 
Follow the instructions at the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) and 
remember to edit the *vite.config.js* file accordingly to your repository

### Configuring with your own domain name

To setup your GH Pages site with a custom domain, [follow the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) on the GitHub Help site for that topic.
